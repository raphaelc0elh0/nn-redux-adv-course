## react-redux-adv-course

Youtube course from The Net Ninja channel

The main goal of this repository is to learn rails&redux advanced patterns, using Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Functions and finally Firebase hosting (now hosted on (https://react-redux-adv-course.firebaseapp.com/). Found this course to be VERY explanatory and complete. Thanks The Net Ninja to provide that.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
