## react-redux-adv-course

Youtube course from The Net Ninja channel

The main goal of this repository is to learn rails&redux advanced patterns, making API requests to a Firebase server, to be used in later projects. Found this course to be very explanatory. Thanks The Net Ninja to provide that.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
